# js-functional-experiment

Theses source are the result of an experiment. Feel free for reading,
use or whatever you want to do with theses

Actually this is the features that are implemented :

* Types
..* Records
..* Number subtyping (ex : set a range that are the new Number type)
..* Define a typed array
..* Define a typed sequence
..* Define a regex pattern as a type
..* Define a typed union
* Function
..* partial applicatoin
..* currying
..* trampoline
..* composition
..* sequence
* An experimental pattern matching
..* It's very experimental pattern matching and inefficient. I just wanted to try to do it
